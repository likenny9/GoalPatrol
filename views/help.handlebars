      <ol>
        <li>Connect with friends by searching for their emails.</li>
        <li>Set a goal for your friend and wait to receive a goal from your friend, or if you've already received a goal from a friend, you can either accept or decline the goal.</li>
        <li>Upon accepting the goal, set up a specific plan for achieving this goal (i.e. how many hours you will spend for a certain number of days per week).</li>
        <li>Record your progress by rating the goal (difficulty, experience, and preference) as you work towards achieving your goal.</li>
        <li>At the end of the week, discuss the goals with your goal patrol buddy, using the progress you've recorded as a reference. </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>Tips</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You can integrate your Google calendar when planning your goals! </li>
          <li>Try to keep the goals you set for your friends as specific as possible so that they can work out a plan for achieving the goal by setting the number of hours they will spend as well as the days they will pick to work on the goal.</li>
